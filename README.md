## 💻 Development

### 🤖 AI-Powered Development Process

This project represents an exciting experiment in AI-assisted development, showcasing how modern AI tools can enhance the software development workflow. The development process was a collaborative effort between human creativity and multiple AI assistants:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Provided intelligent code suggestions and helped with implementation details
- **Microsoft Copilot**: Assisted with project structure and best practices
- **Claude Sonnet 3.5**: Helped refine features and improve user experience

The development followed an iterative process where ideas were proposed, implemented, and refined through continuous dialogue between human developer and AI assistants. This approach led to:

- Rapid prototyping and implementation
- Creative problem-solving through AI suggestions
- Enhanced code quality through AI-assisted reviews
- Innovative feature implementations

This experimental approach demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted development while maintaining human creativity and decision-making at its core.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
